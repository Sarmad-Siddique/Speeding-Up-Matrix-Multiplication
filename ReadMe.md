1) Compile the C, C (with vector instructions), C (with pthreads), C (with pthreads and vector instructions) codes with mc, av, pt, avpt as their object file names respectively.

2) Compile the driver code and the create_input.c file.

3) Using create_input.c file, create an input file (command line arguments need to be passed, their format is given in the file in comments).

4) Run the driver file with input file name and output filename as command line arguments.

5) Wait for the results.
